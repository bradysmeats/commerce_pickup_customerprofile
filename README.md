# Pickup customer profile type #

Defines a Drupal Commerce Customer-Profile type, named Pickup, designed to be used for orders that will be picked up by the customer. Since Brady's Meat & Deli only really cares about the customer's name and phone number(s) for pickup orders, this module only collects the customer's name and phone number.

## Quick start ##

1. Download this module to sites/all/modules.
2. Enable this module.
3. If desired, customize this customer profile type from `Home -> Administration -> Store -> Customer profiles -> Profile types`

## Notes ##

If Bradys' policies change, this module will also change, so it may be of limited use to others. However, it may serve as a useful template for other Drupal commerce sites looking to do something similar.

Works with [Drupal Commerce](http://drupal.org/project/commerce) 7.x-1.x branch.
